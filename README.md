## API Endpoints

The application provides several API endpoints for handling user authentication and database operations. Below are some of the key endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and return a token.
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `GET /api/users`: Fetch all users (protected route).
- `GET /api/posts`: Fetch all posts (protected route).

## Database Setup

To set up your database, follow these steps:

1. **Create a PostgreSQL Database**:

   You can use NeonDB or any PostgreSQL service. Ensure you have the necessary credentials.

2. **Run Migrations**:

   Use Drizzle ORM to set up your database schema. Create migration files as needed.

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

## Authentication

This starter kit uses Better Auth for user authentication. To integrate it:

1. **Install Better Auth**:

   ```bash
   npm install better-auth
   ```

2. **Set Up Authentication**:

   In your API routes, import and configure Better Auth to handle login and registration.

3. **Protect Routes**:

   Use middleware to protect sensitive routes. Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can use platforms like Vercel, Heroku, or any cloud provider that supports Node.js applications. Follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**:

   Run the following command to create an optimized build.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
